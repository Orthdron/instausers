# InstaUsers

This was one of the first golang scraper I wrote to scrape number of followers of users and segregate them into files filtering by number of followers they have.

The program also used channels in golang for multi-threading to speed things up.

To further speed things up, you can add proxies in the file to avoid hitting roadblocks.
